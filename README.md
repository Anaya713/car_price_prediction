Used Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

🚗 Used Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Buying or selling a car often comes down to one question — “What’s the right price?” 💰
This project uses machine learning to predict the resale price of used cars based on parameters such as brand, year, fuel type, mileage, and transmission.

The model was trained on a cleaned car dataset using regression algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, achieving accurate price predictions.
A Streamlit web app was also developed for interactive user inputs and real-time prediction results.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze and clean the car dataset for better prediction accuracy.

Perform feature encoding and scaling on categorical and numerical data.

Build and evaluate ML regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest).

Deploy a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Matplotlib

⚡ Results

Achieved precise price predictions using Random Forest Regression.

Built an interactive app for real-time used car price estimation.

Demonstrated strong correlation between car features and resale value.
